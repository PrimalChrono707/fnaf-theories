        <p>
            1.	In 1970, Henry Emily and William Afton opened a travelling circus. Years before, William had bought out Henry’s struggling company restaurant with farmyard animatronics, a pig, a bear, a chicken, a frog, a hippo, and an elephant. But at the time of the circus, the only one of the two families that had a child was the Aftons, whose son was named Michael. Due to the circus constantly being on the move, neither family had the time to raise any kids, and Mrs. Eleanor Afton had her hands full, only being able to let him see his father during circus hours. The circus closed at night, after Mike’s bedtime, and left for another destination in the early hours of the morning. Mike was still sleeping when his mother loaded him into the car, and woke up after the circus had opened. By the time he was 9, Mike had seen more of the yellow rabbit costume than William Afton. 
        </p>
        <p>
            2.	The main performers consisted of a yellow rabbit, a golden bear, and a clown that performed with jerky, robotic movements. This robot was programmed by Henry to mimic the behavior of William, a decision that would later have disastrous consequences.        </p>
        <p>
            3.	In 1979, William trapped a child inside the backstage and burned the tents. Every single one of the patrons attending the circus had already left, and the only people there were the owners and the employees. And that child. Everyone made it out except the kid. When his body was found, someone called the cops. The police made an investigation, and it was eventually found that the only objects that were not charred to a crisp that could have had fingerprints on them didn’t, meaning that the killer wore gloves. As every single one of the staff played a part whose costume had gloves, William and Henry closed the circus because any of the employees could have been a murderer.         </p>
        <p>
            4.	Later that year, William and Henry decided to stay closer to home and opened Fredbear’s Family Diner in New Harmony, Utah. Just as a precaution, however, this time Henry invented a puppet that would make sure that none of the kids got stolen and killed. The diner was an instant success, and stayed open for three years, when things took a drastic turn.         </p>
        <p>
            5.	Angered that Henry started taking all the credit for Fredbear’s, William decided to get back at his partner and friend. Never good at staying away from alcohol, one night, on his break, he had too much to drink. He took off back to work and found Henry’s daughter, Charlie, outside. Knowing that the puppet inside was incapable of protecting Charlie now, he pulled up in his purple car, grabbed a knife, got out, grabbed Charlie, and stabbed her. He then got back into the car and drove off. The puppet, meanwhile, heard her muffled screams, and rushed outside to find her. Due to the pouring rain, it’s circuits started to short. When it got to Charlie, it collapsed next to her. Charlie’s soul fused to the robotic puppet, and the puppet got to it’s feet, no longer bound by robotics, and disappeared.         </p>
        <p>
            6.	The next morning, when Afton showed up for work, he found Henry standing on the porch, waiting for him. When he got out, Henry asked him if he knew where his daughter was. William replied in the negative, and Henry told him that she had disappeared the night before, and to keep an eye out for her.         </p>
        <p>
            7.	Less than a week later, faulty jaw servos and the innocent pranking nature of Mike, William’s youngest child, David, was bitten in the head by Fredbear and rushed to the ER. During the next week that followed, David and Michael were both plagued by nightmares of the animatronics that Henry was inventing. At the end of the week, David died. The disappearance and death of two kids in one week caused both Mrs. Afton and Mrs. Emily to leave, Mrs. Emily taking their son, Sammy, with her.         </p>
        <p>
            8.	But Eleanor Afton didn’t immediately leave. She stuck around for a little bit longer, hoping that William would come out of his office and spend time with his suffering family. Eventually, though, she, too, left, and Michael was forced to take care of his three younger sisters, Elizabeth, Vanessa, and Jessica.         </p>
        <p>
            9.	In 1984, William opened Circus Baby’s pizza, an act that took the Afton kids by surprise, given that they thought that two kids’ deaths would keep their father from anymore pizza places. However, Elizabeth was excited. The animatronic that her father had told her was for her was one of the animatronics themed for the new pizza place: Circus Baby herself, the fourth version of Charlie that Henry originally made to replace his daughter but stolen by Afton to create Baby. But within a month of opening, William took his kids to the place, and Elizabeth got scooped by Baby. The place closed down that day, blaming the closure on a gas leak, and for another few months, nothing eventful happened; William locked himself back into his office, and Michael was once again tasked with caring for his father’s daughters.         </p>
        <p>
            10.	Later that year, William and Henry both opened the very first Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. This restaurant themed a chicken named Chica, a bear named Freddy, and a bunny named Bonnie. This went fine until five more kids disappeared. The place closed down a month later due to people suing the owners for health reasons (the animatronics had started oozing blood and mucus, giving the impression that the bodies of the kids had been stuffed into the suits). The animatronics were decommissioned temporarily for inspection, but nothing was ever found. After this, Afton stole the animatronics and melted them together and transferred the melted Remnant (soul-infused metal) into his Funtime animatronics. After that, the golden bear and rabbit were used for entertainment until the golden rabbit suit had a springlock malfunction, killing William Afton, the man who was wearing it. Unable to get the suit off of the man, management did the unthinkable: they just dragged the dead man inside the saferoom, told any Afton still living that they’d inherited William’s businesses, and locked the room.        </p>
        <p>
            11.	A year later, Freddy’s opened back up. But this time, the saferoom was opened by an unaware employee and Spring Bonnie went right back to killing. This time, one of his potential victims, Oswald, whose father was a participant in the David Afton incident, rescued some of Afton’s other potential victims from getting turned into more of his soul-slaves. The restaurant was closed down, but Afton wasn’t returned to the saferoom. Instead, he found a way to remove the suit from his body and returned, at least temporarily, to being human. In 1986, Michael Afton received a letter.         </p>
        <p>
            12.	Due to the disappearance of both Mike’s mother and father, he was decided to be the only living Afton, meaning he had inherited Afton Robotics, LLC, and therefore Circus Baby’s Entertainment and Rentals. He went into the bunker connected to his father’s office, and heard his little sister, Elizabeth’s, voice, saying the last things Michael ever heard her say, like asking William why she couldn’t play with Baby. This repeat of her voice slammed her death right back into Mike’s brain. He made his next mission to find out where she was, and if he could save her. Not too long after he found out that her soul was possessing Circus Baby, he got his insides scooped out of him and replaced by the amalgamation of animatronic named Ennard. When his body started to rot, Ennard left an escaped into the sewers. But somehow, Mike had survived. His body had turned purple with rot, but he was still alive.         </p>
        <p>
            13.	When, one day, Mike didn’t come home, sisters Jess and Ness started to panic. They were only six years old, and they didn’t have anyone to care for them. Eventually, someone from around town took them in, and they were raised by Americans.        </p>
        <p>
            14.	In 1987, Mike took on his first job as a night guard for the new Freddy’s. Here, the animatronics were brand new, shiny versions of what they used to be. Less than a month before Mike took on a job, a guy named Ralph, the security guard at the time, was tasked with recording messages for future night guards. The phone guy guard of 1985 had been an actual Fazbear employee that told the security guards how to handle things, but Henry had told Ralph to record messages for future guards so that they wouldn’t have to pay another guy to train the guards. One of the final tapes he (Ralph) had made, however, the animatronics that were used a few years before had broken into his office and – you know what happened.         </p>
        <p>
            15.	Those same animatronics were used alongside the Toy ones for a while, but the Purple Guy, trying to stop the animatronics from killing him, broke in one night (management had informed him that he was under a background check, and he was not to enter the building under any circumstances. The building even went on lockdown) and dismantled them. History repeated itself that night, and the souls that were trapped inside the robots were released, and, confronted by something completely unimaginable, Afton retreated back into the saferoom, and into the suit. His fear and the dampness of the unused room resulted in the already unsafe springlocks to go off, skewering him alive once more. The saferoom was sealed off again, never to be opened for a long, long time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            16.	But now that his body was dead and his soul fused to the suit, Michael had a new-found connection with his father. He told William that he was going to come find him, and kill him. William, surprised that his son could talk to him, let alone that fact that he was hunting him, sat up in shock.        </p>
        <p>
            17.	Over the next six years, Henry Emily, without the help of his former co-owner and friend, managed to turn Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza into the next great attraction, nation-wide. However, strange things would happen to random people. [more information coming soon]        </p>
        <p>
            18.	In 1993, Mike again got a job at Freddy’s as a night guard. The phone guy informed him of things he already knew: the animatronics were allowed to roam at night to keep their servos from locking up, something Henry learned when David Afton got bit; the bite of ’87, where the security guard before Mike got bit by Mangle and his frontal lobe removed; he (Mike) also knew that the animatronics would try to stuff anyone else inside an animatronic suit, but they were out to kill him because a) he looked like his father and b) the Yellow Rabbit had told them to kill Mike. These recordings, though, seemed like they were made after the ones Mike heard in ’87. The repeat of Fazbear’s slogan, the mention of the “Bite of ‘87”, something that hadn’t happened until Mike got hired – Mike wondered when these recordings were made.         </p>
        <p>
            19.	After learning that these particular animatronics at this particular location were the ones that had originally contained the bodies and souls of the dead kids of ’87 (Afton having killed more kids before getting killed himself), he burned the building to the ground, hoping that fire would kill the souls – again.         </p>
        <p>
            20.	After this event, Henry was paranoid that his franchise locations had become cursed with his dead friend’s murderous schemes, and he closed down every location in the country. This decision was so sudden that it caught everyone off guard. But some kids, deciding to explore the locations that had been abandoned for years, accidentally uncovered things that should have been left alone: an animatronic dog that would take anyone’s wants as a request to retrieve, some kid finding the golden Fredbear suit and accidentally getting his friend killed in it, and other things [more info coming soon].        </p>
        <p>
            21.	Thirty years after the Bite of ’87, in 2017, Henry decided to open a new version of Freddy’s: Fazbear Frights, the Horror Attraction. This time, though, he opened it, but hired somebody else to be the boss. He wasn’t going to bear it if this, too, got closed, and he was the one in charge. In order to be able to pay this new boss, he told management that the night guard office was to be built with outdated technology, stuff that was inexpensive and that had been used in a Freddy’s before. After all, what would be the point in giving the night guard a brand-new gig? As long as he has the cameras to do his job, and the ventilation to keep him from suffocating, everything would be fine.         </p>
        <p>
            22.	But it wasn’t fine. Unknowing, Henry made the mistake of using the ’87 Freddy’s location for Fazbear’s Fright. The saferoom was again opened up, and the people who opened it found Springtrap. They decided to use the ruined animatronic because, in addition to looking terrifying, somehow it still worked. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    23.	The new boss hired Mike to be the security guard. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    24.	After finding out that his father was the animatronic trying to murder him, Mike set the place ablaze. Fully convinced that he’d ended his father, Mike left, also convinced that Freddy Fazbear’s was out of his life for good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    25.	Springtrap had other plans. The building burning around him, he got up and left the building, retreating to the one person that he knew could help him: his wife.
                </p>
                <p>
                    26.	The next year, in 2018, a boy named Oswald, irritated that his father kept leaving him at Jeff’s Pizza (actually what was left the 1985 Freddy’s location after it closed), found a dirty old ball pit and decided to hide in it. Make his dad actually “make an effort” for a change. But upon entering the pit, he found that he’d time travelled into the past – 1985, to be exact. After finding half a dozen kids dead in a party room and escaping death via yellow rabbit, he managed to rescue his father and escape the past. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    27.	After this, Eleanor Afton rebuilt Springtrap. She wondered where Elizabeth was, but couldn’t do anything about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    28.	In 2023, Mike saw an online add for a “Fazbear Franchise Package.” This could only mean one thing: Henry had discovered that his ex-best friend was still alive. He called Henry, and Henry told him that the plan was to lure the animatronics to the new Freddy’s with the promise of more kids, and then burn the place, hopefully freeing the souls. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    29.	During the week that Mike was working there, salvaging animatronics (Scraptrap, Scrap Baby, and Molten Freddy [the last two of which rebuilt themselves; Ennard booted Baby, so she rebuilt herself. Funtime Freddy took over after she left, which is interesting given the fact that Funtime Foxy sees himself as the Ringmaster])  and keeping them in the vents, Henry, on a tape, told Mike how he had survived the scooper and explained the basics of Remnant. At the end of the week, Henry burned the building to the ground. Mike and Henry both stayed inside the building when it burned, knowing that Mike was finished trying to live as a rotting corpse, and Henry was tired of trying to keep a franchise alive and his attempts backfiring. This new Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza Place was Henry’s way of giving up. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    30.	But of course, in the words of Springtrap, he “Always [comes] back!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    31.	Eleanor Afton managed to rebuild Fazbear Entertainment. She now built Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex on top of the ruins of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza Place, knowing that her husband was down there. She infused some leftover Remnant into his destroyed body, rebuilt as much of him as she dared, and kept him inside a life-support chamber. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    32.	But part of Springtrap managed to embed itself into a circuit board. When Mrs. Afton sent Fazbear the scrap parts to make a VR game out of, this consciousness managed to plant itself into the game, taking control of whoever played it. 
                </p>
        <p>
            33.	After the VR game was made, Mrs. Afton went on a Remnant obsession. She hired out brand new animatronics for at home parties that would kill people and return with their Remnant. She also Hired someone to create three video games that would “make light” of Fazbear’s past – just kidding, it would make a mockery of said past so that people would like Freddy’s again.         </p>
        <p>
            34.	Unknown to Eleanor Afton, the new building, Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex, was under the control of three beings: Charlie Emily was trying to take control so that she could end Springtrap, Elizabeth Afton was trying to help her father, and Glitchtrap was trying to get to Gregory.         </p>
            <p>
                35.	Vanessa Afton was trying to help her reincarnated brother by finding him and getting him out of the Pizzaplex. But Gregory thought she was the bad guy, partly because she had wiped his memories of being David so that if her father did manage to capture him, he wouldn’t be able to tell him anything. 
            </p>
            <p>
                36.	Michael Afton, possessing Glamrock Freddy, was assisting his younger brother in escaping the Pizzaplex. Almost at the point of escaping, Burntrap started to hack Freddy. Mike’s presence delayed it, but Gregory had to burn Burntrap to save Freddy. While Burntrap was trying to get to Gregory, the Blob (a mess of animatronics that hadn’t been put to rest and charged with Agony consisting of Funtime Freddy, Mangle, Bonnie, and others – Baby and the Puppet were not present in their bodies because they were fighting over control of the Pizzaplex) grabbed Burntrap by the neck and dragged him off. In the process of escaping, Vanny (Jessica Afton) dismantled Freddy. Gregory grabbed Freddy’s head and stuffed it into his bag. He then told the S.T.A.F.F. bots to disassemble Vanny. After doing so, Gregory left, and Vanessa left with him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                37.	Vanessa also restored Gregory’s memories, and Mike’s soul kept the animatronic animated.
            </p>
            <p>
                38.	David, Vanessa, and Mike were back together.  
            </p>
            <p>
                39.	Years after all this happened, Mike’s friend that had been wearing a Bonnie mask when David died, was hired as a beta-tester for Fazbear’s second VR game, but this resulted in him getting killed and his soul stuffed inside of a S.T.A.F.F. bot, giving his daughter a Vanny mask.
            </p>
            <p>
                40.	This same daughter, Cassie, was in the ruined Pizzaplex responding to a S.O.S. from Gregory. She used the Vanny mask to get to him, but Glitchtrap was trying to plant his consciousness into her so that he could take on another physical form. He failed, but Cassie accidentally uncovered Henry Emily’s first sentient creation: The Mimic. The Mimic was what had lured Cassie there in the first place, not Gregory. While escaping from it, the real Gregory contacted Cassie, saying that he couldn’t have them finding him, and dropped the elevator Cassie was in. Her fate is unknown.

I do believe that Into the Pit was mostly designed to tell us to throw everything together and use our imagination to solve the puzzle, but that opens up more holes than it fills; for instance, if we're supposed to use our imagination to complete this thing, that makes it too easy. But that is what I did, and in the absence of any other information I will stick to this timeline until someone or something uses solid, concrete evidence to proove me absolutely wrong. Hope I gave you something to chew on!!
