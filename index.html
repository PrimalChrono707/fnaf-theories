            The Afton Effect:
            </h4>
        </Header>
        <p>
            In 1970, old friends Henry Emily and William Afton started a travelling circus. They moved around so much that only the Aftons managed to have a child, but they had him just before the circus opened. They didn’t have any more kids until the 80s – but we’ll get there later.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1979, William Afton trapped a child inside the tent during circus hours and set it alight. The entirety of the circus and its equipment was charred, as well as the robot that Henry had made to mimic the behavior of William and act as a third performer. When the circus burned down, the two decided to forget travel business and stick to one spot. So they opened Fredbear’s Family Diner in New Harmony, Utah, U.S. In 1980, Henry Emily’s wife gave birth to a girl named Charlotte. In the same year, Mrs. Afton gave birth to triplets: three girls named Elizabeth, Vanessa, and Jessica. In 1983, William killed Henry’s daughter, and the security puppet that was supposed to protect Charlie ended up being possessed by her soul. While killing Charlie, William failed to repair the damaged Fredbear suit, and this resulted in the death of William’s son David, because of a prank Michael Afton pulled on his brother’s third birthday.
        </p>
        <p>
            The diner closed down due to two deaths in the course of a week, and later that year, William Afton started Afton Robotics, LLC. He opened Circus Baby’s Pizza, which was closed on the day of opening due to the death of Afton’s daughter, Elizabeth, by Circus Baby herself, the animatronic originally created by Henry to replace his daughter, but stolen by William to create a machine that was supposed to be for his daughter, but eventually became a children-kidnap machine. It grabbed Elizabeth and pulled her inside the chest cavity, and springlocked her. Circus Baby’s closed, and, already insane from the death of his youngest, William locked himself underground in the Circus Baby’s Entertainment and Rentals facility. While down there, he constructed the Funtime animatronics, which consisted of a clown-themed bear, Circus Baby, Ballora the Ballerina modeled after his wife, whom he thought was blind to the thought of immortality, and a clown-themed fox. This sudden lack of attention on William’s part drove his wife, Eleanor Afton, to leave. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In early 1984, William and Henry opened Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. In this restaurant, William killed five more kids. He managed to hide them so effectively that nobody found them until the animatronics started acting up. The puppet (possessed by Charlie Emily) had found the bodies and stuffed them into the animatronics without anybody knowing. The souls of the kids had fused to the robots, causing them to seek the man in purple, in order to kill him. Knowing this, Afton dismantled the animatronics, only to be confronted by the souls of the dead kids. He then entered into the yellow rabbit suit, knowing that the kids wouldn’t hurt the rabbit. But the dampness of the unused saferoom caused the springlocks in the suit to malfunction, killing Afton. He collapsed, and the restaurant was closed due to the Missing Children’s Incident, and Afton was locked away and forgotten. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A year later, in 1985, Freddy’s was re-opened, and the saferoom unlocked. The yellow rabbit suit managed to get up and return to killing. This time, one of his potential victims, Oswald, managed to recover his father, whom Afton had kidnapped and posed as, and escaped. This angered Afton, because none of his victims had ever before escaped. Later that month, the restaurant closed back down. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1986, Michael Afton, now 16 years old, received a letter explaining that due to the disappearances of both his father and mother, Fazbear Entertainment had gone to Henry, while Afton Robotics was now under his (Michael’s) ownership. He went down into the bunker of Circus Baby’s Entertainment and Rentals, only to discover that Circus Baby was, in addition to being possessed by his little sister, crazed by the thought of seeing the sky again and willing to do anything to get it. After having his insides and bones scooped out of his living body, and the amalgamation of the Funtime animatronics named Ennard squeezed into him and then squeezed out, he found that somehow, in some way, he was still alive. He then, knowing that he now had a connection with his long dead father, told William that he was “going to come find [him],” and that he “should be dead, but [he’s] not.” The Springtrap, now locked again in the saferoom, jolted to a sitting position in shock. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1987, Michael, having now sold the rights to CBER to an anonymous buyer, got a job at the newly re-opened Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, but, after getting bit by Henry’s version of Funtime Foxy, modeled after the Funtime fox of the original circus, and having his frontal lobe removed, he was fired for a) tampering with the animatronics b) unprofessionalism and c) odor (caused by being a rotting, undead corpse). 
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the course of the next 6 years, Henry Emily had successfully created the Freddy Fazbear’s franchise. The restaurant chain had become a success. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1993, Michael again got a job as a Freddy’s nightguard, but was eventually fired for again tampering with the animatronics, unprofessionalism, and odor. This time, the reused animatronics thought that Michael was his father, so, in acts of revenge, they were trying to kill him. All the more reason to find and kill William. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1997, Henry opened Fazbear’s Fright, the Horror Attraction. This was opened in the same building as the original Freddy’s, and this time, again, the saferoom was unlocked and the Spring Bonnie animatronic was used for the horror aspect. Here, Michael again was hired on as the nightguard, and he found his father and burned the building to the ground. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, Springtrap didn’t die. He was severely burned by the fire, but he wasn’t killed. Instead, he got up and left.
        </p>
        <p>
            The same year, a boy named Oswald, annoyed at his father, entered a time-traveling ball pit and found himself a witness to the 1985 murders. In the process of rescuing his father, he rescued other children from worse fates. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the early 2000s, Mrs. Afton found what was left of his body in a back alley one day, and decided to recreate him. She salvaged the face, leg, and torso parts of other scrapped animatronics, removed the outer plating from the endoskeleton, and repaired him. Now, he had a different face, different feet, and even his torso was unrecognizable. She did the same for Ennard afterward, when she found him. After they were repaired, she threw them away again, likely revolted at what she had done. Circus Baby, on the other hand, reconstructed herself. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime on February 2nd, 2003, Henry Emily had constructed an animatronic designed to lure, encapsulate, fuse, transport, and extract the puppet. Only, the F, T, and E never happened. It captured the puppet and brought her to the brand new Freddy’s, where the other, newly repaired animatronics found themselves. On the same day as Lefty’s creation, Henry recorded a tape explaining to Michael how the animatronics had managed to come to life due to remnant, and how Michael had survived being scooped. Michael, owner of the new Freddy’s, brought them inside to use them for parts – or so it seemed. Michael was pretending to be a normal person trying to make a living, but in reality, he was assisting Henry in destroying the animatronics and freeing the souls. This worked, and ended with Henry burning down the building, with himself and Mike inside it, to end the memory of everything that had happened and put the souls of all those lost to rest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            But it didn’t work.
        </p>
        <p>
            What neither of them could have predicted was the fact that it wasn’t just the souls that needed killing, it was the agony. Agony-infused animatronics can still live on without a soul, meaning that Henry hadn’t killed them, just angered them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Afton now inherited Fazbear Entertainment, and, in 2005, opened the Freddy Fazbear’s Mega Pizzaplex. This was built on top of the ruins of Michael’s restaurant, and the Glamrock Freddy robot was built with parts that contained Michael’s agony. Michael had been reborn. She also used Henry’s techniques to rebuild her long-lost son, David, something that William had never been able to do. What was left of the charred Afton was salvaged, and, despite the lack of a soul, she rebuilt it and used the agony to keep it alive. The soul, meanwhile, had passed on into a personal hell made for him by Cassidy, one of the residents of Golden Freddy, and the victim that Afton had practically tortured to death. As revenge for her gruesome death, she gave Afton one – one that would forever be permanent. Also, for some reason, the soul of Charlie Emily was still alive, and now was fighting Glitchtrap for control over the Pizzaplex.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time, Vanessa Afton, now 25 years old, was anonymously hired by her mother to be the security guard for the Pizzaplex. He sister, Jessica, posing as her sister, had previously been corrupted by William Afton, who knew that she would not willingly kidnap her brother. William wanted David because he wanted to figure out how he had been made. Figuring this out would allow him to recreate himself. Vanessa, though, found David first, and deleted his digital memories of being David Afton to protect him. But, deep down, David – now known as Gregory, a name he made for himself because he didn’t know his real one – knew that Vanny, who was posing as her sister, was evil, and came to associate Vanessa with Vanny, a mistake that he and his robotic brother, Freddy (Michael) both made. Eventually, Afton almost managed to capture Gregory by corrupting Freddy, which, thanks to Mike, was a delayed process. At the same time, the evil Vanessa was defeated, and Vanessa, David, and Mike were all reunited. 
        </p>
        <p>
            So this raises the questions – Why is Charlie trying to control the Pizzaplex, and where has Elizabeth gone? The only reason Charlie didn’t die in the FNaF 6 fire is because agony kept her alive, but what is her new purpose? Does she know that William is still alive, and in different forms? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Elizabeth has all but disappeared – the only reason we know she isn’t dead is because she wouldn’t possibly move on to the afterlife if she knew that her father was still alive. She was so desperate for her father’s gratitude that she was willing to kill her own brother, so she wouldn’t have passed on knowing that her father always comes back. So where is she? What is her new goal?
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, WHAT CONNECTION DOES OSWALD HAVE TO THE EMILY’S AND THE AFTONS!?!?!?! The attic of Oswald’s house contained his father’s old Freddy mask, and Charlie Emily’s pet unicorn, Stanley! The saferoom of Freddy’s where Oswald found his father contained Gerret’s plane from the FNaF Movie (something that Oswald almost made a reference to [“This is just like that movie, F-“), the picture of Henry and William from the graphic novels, Charlie’s faces project from The Twisted Ones, and more. WHY ARE ALL OF THOSE THERE!?!?! It doesn’t make any sense. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On the subject of Into the Pit, why is there a fourth Paperpal? It's been theorized in the past that the bunny is William Afton, the bear is Henry Emily, and the third, unidentified one is the Mimic, but what on earth could this fourth one be?

                The Ripple Effect:

        </header>
        <p>
            After the collapse of the Mega Pizzaplex, a girl named Cassie was drawn into the ruins by the Mimic, pretending to be her friend Gregory, trapped inside the Pizzaplex. She survived the Mimic, only to be almost killed by the real Gregory, who said he couldn’t have it following him. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Cassie’s father, the boy in the rabbit mask when David Afton was killed, was murdered by Glitchtrap and had his consciousness transferred into a S.T.A.F.F. bot, that would eventually give his daughter the mask that set Glitchtrap free.

                Explainations:
            </h4>
        </header>
        <p>
            So, I can practically hear all of you screaming at me for creating a timeline that is completely different from the majority timeline, and I understand why. I changed the dates of FNaFs 3 and 6, changed the dates for FNaF 5 and the Circus Baby’s Pizza event, and I even added a Freddy’s location to the timeline! But I had reasons for doing so. Let me explain. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s start with paragraph 1. We know thanks to FNaF VR 2 that Fall Fest, a fall themed circus, was opened in 1970. In 1983, Michael Afton (Foxy Bro) is roughly 13. That puts his birthday in 1970. If he was born before the circus opened, that would explain the major differences between his age and the ages of his siblings. Realistically, the Aftons wouldn’t have been able to parent four kids if the circus was always on the move. That’s why they didn’t have any more kids until the 80s.
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 2: We know that William trapped a kid inside the circus tent that he burned because the Mimic was present. The Mimic was programmed to mimic William’s behavior. This is the last we see of the Mimic until Security Breach, in 2005. So how could the Mimic have learned to kill kids if it didn’t see William do it? The location of Fredbear’s in very clearly given in the FNaF novel, The Silver Eyes. The Fourth Closet says that Charlie was born in 1980. Since William and Henry were both doing the same thing for the same amount of time that prevented them from having any or more kids, it’s safe to assume that the Aftons also had kids – David (The Crying Child) in 1981-2, and Elizabeth, Vanessa and Jessica (I Googled Vanny’s personality and came out to “Someone who could brighten a room.” While searching for names that meant that, I came across the name Jessica. This means “to behold” or “to see”, likely a reference to Glamrock Freddy telling Vanny that “I can see you now.” Jessica was the #1 most popular girl name in the 80s, and one of Charlie’s friends in the first three FNaF novels was named Jessica.) in the same year. We know that William killed Charlie Emily (that’s pretty much common knowledge at this point) and we know that the Fredbear animatronic accidentally killed David Afton due to a faulty servo in the jaw based on the fact that the Phone Guy said that the animatronics were allowed to roam at night to keep their servos healthy. Why would the servos be a problem if there never was a problem? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 3: It’s likely that in order to raise business, the two friends semi-split to create two different sister companies. Afton Robotics ended up being a failure when Circus Baby’s Pizza got closed due to the death of Elizabeth. Afton opened CBER afterwards, and that became Afton’s way of farming Remnant, the soul metal. The Fourth Closet novel implies that Henry originally built Baby as the fourth version of robot-Charlie (and FNaF World supports this), but he never finished it; William did. Henry got the animatronic back and sealed it inside his house before faking his death (we know he did this because Charlie and everyone she knows thinks that Henry is dead, but he’s clearly alive five or six years after the first three novels take place). I also know that Mrs. Afton’s name is Eleanor because this name is of Greek origin meaning light-hearted or shining-light, obviously how William thought of her before she left, at which time he constructed Ballora with her eyes closed because he now thought of her as blind to his dreams. Eleanor is also the name that Baby used in the Fazbear Frights story, “To be Beautiful,” posing as her mother just like William posed as his son in The Silver Eyes, taking on the name of Dave. We can also place the decade that Mrs. Afton was born in, because the latest decade before the 80s I could find the name of Eleanor was in the 40s. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 4: The reason I know that there was a Freddy’s in 1984 is because in Into the Pit, William Afton had already been springlocked. We know this thanks to one of his voicelines: “I will make you suffer, just like I did.” We also know thanks to a FNaF 3 minigame that he got springlocked at a Freddy’s location. How could he have already been springlocked in what was assumed to be the first Freddy’s? So I added a location in 1984. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 5: Into the Pit tells us that the saferoom was unlocked a) because Spring Bonnie is alive and killing, and b) because you can enter the saferoom. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 6: How do I know that FNaF SL takes place in 1986? Simply because Michael is a rotting corpse in literally every other game he shows up in except 4. FNaFs 1 and 2, he’s fired for odor. FNaF 3 takes place after 2, meaning he’s still rotten, and 6 is where he died. He’s not rotten in 4 because Elizabeth hasn’t died yet and Eleanor hasn’t left. Henry was the closest owner for Fazbear Entertainment, and Michael was the oldest living heir to his father’s company. The only way he could have possibly told his father that he was going to come find him while Springtrap was currently locked in a saferoom was if the undead have almost telepathic connections with each other. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 7: I like Game Theory’s old idea that Mrs. Afton is the owner of Fazbear Entertainment LLC. It’s the only thing that makes sense right now. And if she, like that theory suggested, also owned CBER, she had to have anonymously purchased it from her son. Also, if Michael was posing as Jeremy Fitzgerald and got himself bit, being a rotting corpse wouldn’t have affected him. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 8: I know this because if there was only one location in 1993, then the paycheck would have had a year on it. The 1987 location paycheck had a year because Henry was the owner of the only location. Being as organized as he seems, that would explain why he included a year. If the FNaF 1 location was one of many locations, then the GM of that store in particular might not include a year. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 9: This is old news. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 10: This one had to have been opened in the late 90s because even thirty years after the closing of the original Freddy’s would be way too late in the timeline. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 11: This, too, is old news.
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 12: I know the approximate year of Oswald’s time like so: In 1985, one of Oswald’s friends says that the new school teacher is Mrs. Meecham, the same teacher that Oswald has. Given how she looks, the events of 1985 can’t have happened that long before Oswald’s time. If Oswald’s father was 12 in 83, and roughly 30 in Into the Pit, there is a roughly 15 year difference between 1985 and Oswald’s time. If Mrs. Meecham is approximately in her 40s in Oswald’s time, that would have put her in her 20s in 85 – just about young teaching age. In addition, the only year in the late 90s that had August 16th on a Thursday was ’97. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 13: The scrapped animatronics have got to have been rebuilt. There is no other explanation. The significant differences in Afton’s feet, torso, head, and everything else implies that someone rebuilt him. The only person with an attachment to Afton strong enough to rebuild him would have been his wife. She also had to have done this for Ennard, since Baby would not, as she was kicked out of the Ennard clan and likely rebuilt herself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 14: I know that the date of FNaF 6 is February 2nd, 2003 because of this: “HRY223.” Given the accuracy of the paycheck he gave Mike in 1987, Henry would be likely to accurately date his tape with a month and day rather than just a year that doesn’t make sense. He also created Lefty for the sole purpose of reobtaining his daughter to set her soul free. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 15: Stay tuned.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 16: In one of the Fazbear Frights books, I don’t remember which, it said that a scientist named Phineas was experimenting with agony. His tests resulted in the creation of the Stitchwraith, an animatronic monster that, at first, was powered not by a soul, but by the agony of dozens of agony-infused objects, similar to Ella, Charlie’s doll. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 17: At the end of FNaF 6, the narrator said the Fazbear Entertainment was “no longer a corporate entity.” So why is FE still alive to create the Pizzaplex under the name of Fazbear Entertainment, LLC, when FE Inc should have been dead? The only explanation is the only surviving relative of an owner, which happened to be Mrs. Afton (idea was built on by me, but was originally the theory that Game Theory came up with). We also know that Michael is possessing Glamrock Freddy thanks to Game Theory. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 18: I know that Mrs. Afton used Henry’s techniques to recreate her son because of what the Paragraph in question said: William never could. William may have made the promise (something I question due to the fact that William would never make a promise he wouldn’t keep), but he never fulfilled it. In the books, this was proven by the fact that he kept trying to recreate Charlie’s robotic life, but was never able to. He needed Charlie to do that, and he never got ahold of her. The rest of this paragraph is Game Theory news. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Paragraph 19: I know that Jessica was posing as Vanessa because FNaF VR refers to her as “Ness”, short for Vanessa, way back when she was starting to get corrupted. I still don’t know why she was posing as her sister, but that’s the only thing that makes sense. The only thing that William could have wanted Gregory for was to figure out what made him tick, so that William could mimic that and become immortal. 
        </p>

                Extra Notes:
            </h4>
        </header>
        <p>
            First of all, Vanessa from Security Breach talks with an American accent. I can explain this, too. If my theory is right, and the last member of the Aftons disapeared in '86, then no one was left to care for Ness and Jess. So if someone from their hometown maybe decided to take them in and raise them, odds are those people were American. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing, the Midnight Motorist minigame from Freddy Fazbear's Pizzaria Simulator has always stumped the best of FNaF lore hunters. There is a secret in that minigame where you can go to a house and some weird stuff happens (for spoiler reasons, I won't go any further) but I truly believe that the couch potato from that minigame is Eleanor Afton. Let me explain. When that figure on the sofa watching TV tells Afton that "He's had a rough day, give him a break" he didn't do anything. He didn't snap, no nothing. The only reason Michael would have been having a rough day is if he'd been having nightmares, which Afton didn't make him have until David was dead. So, after the death of his son, Afton started to go insane. If he wasn't present to help Eleanor raise his kids (Afton strikes me as the kind of guy that puts work over family) then he'd have no real, emotional connection with his kids. But, he might have had a genuine connection with his WIFE. If that is the case, that would explain why he didn't resort to abuse when she spoke to him. The most he could do was ignore her - end even then, he'd regret it.

            I also noticed (having watched the movie for the first time the night before writing this) that the Ghost Kid that seems to possess Golden Freddy (also the only one that actually talks to Mike) at times will speak with a slight British accent, implying that he's Afton's son. For example: "[American] We want [British] Abby."

            I also noticed that the poster for the collection of the first three FNaF novels has a depiction of Springtrap. This springtrap has sharp claws, two front buck teeth, and a bottom jaw full of sharp, nightmare-style teeth. Sound familiar? Use this for reference:

            This Springtrap from the poster looks almost exactly like Afton, commonly called Scraptrap. The same holds true for the rest of the scrapped animatronics; for instance, Scrap Baby and Molten Freddy. (I'll supply an image of the poster for reference)

            Scrap Baby has different, individual hairs, just like the Baby from the poster. Molten Freddy isn't directly shown in the poster, but the description for the Freddy (commonly believed to be Nightmare) that carts Charlie to the FNaF 2 location in the books not only shows up many times, but it's also described as being a mess of wires, a face distinctly different from normal Freddy's yet somehow they couldn't put their fingers on it (just like Molten Freddy in my opinion) with a single illuminated eye, being the left one.

            Disclaimer: This timeline was created by one person (me) and one person ONLY. I cannot guarantee that everything is accurate, and I definetly cannot guarantee that I've solved FNaF. I do believe that Into the Pit was mostly designed to tell us to throw everything together and use our imagination to solve the puzzle, but that opens up more holes than it fills; for instance, if we're supposed to use our imagination to complete this thing, that makes it too easy. But that is what I did, and in the absence of any other information I will stick to this timeline until someone or something uses solid, concrete evidence to proove me absolutely wrong. Hope I gave you something to chew on!!
