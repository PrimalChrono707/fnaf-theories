            So listen - a few months before writing this I had no idea about FNAF lore at all. The only source I had was to watch Game Theory. I fully understand why people don't like Game Theory. They take the lore of video games and completely contradict what the fans say the lore is. But, I don't think that people should be that mad because when they in particular have an idea, they use logic and imagination to prove their point. People should not think that they and they alone are correct and everyone else is wrong. If that's your opinion, why are you here? Give them a chance. But anyways, my point is that a lot of what's in this timeline is a result of watching Game Theory. Other stuff, though, is the product of my own imagination. Readers Beware!!!!: THIS TIMELINE CONTRADICTS A LOT OF THE MAJORITY TIMELINE, SO IF YOU LIKE THAT ONE, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE MINE. You have been warned!

            I just discovered some groundbreaking information, new timeline coming soon!! [Just be patient; it's coming.] Also note that as of writing this timeline, I have not read the last four Fazbear Frights books or the Tales From the Pizzaplex books. Most of my information is therefore going to be debatable.

            Disclaimer: This timeline was created by one person (me) and one person ONLY. I cannot guarantee that everything is accurate, and I definetly cannot guarantee that I've solved FNaF. I do believe that Into the Pit was mostly designed to tell us to throw everything together and use our imagination to solve the puzzle, but that opens up more holes than it fills; for instance, if we're supposed to use our imagination to complete this thing, that makes it too easy. But that is what I did, and in the absence of any other information I will stick to this timeline until someone or something uses solid, concrete evidence to prove me absolutely wrong. Hope I gave you something to chew on!!

        P.S. Can somebody please get me up to date on the other FNAF books I don't have [Fazbear Frights 9-12 and Tales From the Pizzaplex 1-8]? Even if you have to edit the source code (if you can find it)
