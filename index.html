                This page contains spoilers. If spoilers aren't your thing, try again later. If you wish for a little backstory for your first FNaF gameplay, you've hit the jackpot.

            Disclaimer: This timeline was created by one person (me) and one person ONLY. I cannot guarantee that everything is accurate, and I definetly cannot guarantee that I've solved FNaF. I do believe that Into the Pit was mostly designed to tell us to throw everything together and use our imagination to solve the puzzle, but that opens up more holes than it fills; for instance, if we're supposed to use our imagination to complete this thing, that makes it too easy. But that is what I did, and in the absence of any other information I will stick to this timeline until someone or something uses solid, concrete evidence to prove me absolutely wrong. Hope I gave you something to chew on!!
